## 📝 How to Play

The game starts with Player 1.  
Each player takes turns to roll the dice.  
The dice generates a number between 1 and 6.  

- **On each roll:**
  - If the dice rolls 2–6: The number is added to the player's current score.
  - If the dice rolls 1: The current score resets to 0, and the turn switches to the next player.

- **Players can choose to:**
  - Roll again: Take the risk of rolling for a higher score.
  - Hold: Add the current score to their total and pass the turn.

The first player to reach 100 points is the winner! 🏆
